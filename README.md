## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Situation
I was hired by the operator of the Boardgame Bar Bonn to create a website for their bar. The bar has a new concept that is currently unique in Bonn and is not yet known to many people. The bar has a large collection of games available for guests to borrow and play. The Boardgame Bar Bonn aims to become a permanent meeting place for all board game lovers and fans in Bonn and the surrounding area. It wants to create an incentive to try out new games and make new contacts with like-minded people.

The bar only opened 3 months ago. The website is an important means for the bar to become better known and to attract attention. It offers all the necessary information at a glance and distributes all information to both regular customers and interested parties.

Visitors to the site are board game enthusiasts aged between 10 and 70. There are also games for younger people in the bar. It is assumed that they will visit the bar accompanied by an adult and will therefore not inform themselves.

The website should provide guests with all the important information about the bar so that they can plan their visit. It makes work easier for operators and staff because the same questions that keep coming up are no longer necessary. At the same time, the website increases awareness of the bar and contributes to customer loyalty by providing up-to-date information.

The most important information is therefore the concept of the bar, opening hours, address, contact details, news and the menus.

### User Story
#### The goal of the Boardgame Bar Bonn as operator:
- They want more customers to come to the bar. Accordingly, information about the opening hours, address, contact options, the bar concept and the menu should be represented on the website.
- They want to inform your regular customers about games or offers via the website.
- They want the website to be easily accessible for all users and to work on any device.
- They want to offer customers a way to enter to reserve a seat.
- They want the site to be usable by everyone.
- They want more that the links to the social media channels are easy to find to get more followers.

#### The Goal of a first-time visitor to the website:
- Would like to know what concept the bar has.
- Wants to know where the bar is located.
- Wants to know when it is open- Wants to know what food and drinks are available there
- Would like to know what games are available
- Would like to know how much it costs to play there
- Would like to be able to contact the bar for questions.
- Would like links to the bar's social media.

#### Goal of second first-time visitor to the website
- Would like to see the address and opening hours again to plan his visit
- Would like to make contact to reserve a table
- Would like to subscribe to the newsletter

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
- Would like to know what news there is. Offers or new games
- Would like to make contact to reserve a table

## Design
### Color Scheme
In consultation with the customer, the colors were based on the colors of the locale. Bright, friendly shades were chosen there. I used the website https://mycolor.space/ to find other matching colors for the base color.

Finally, I checked the contrast again with the page https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/

![](assets/images/readme-images/color3.webp "Color palette3")

### Typography
The fonts come from Googlefonds and were used for the following fonts:
- PT Sans Narrow is used for headings on the site. It is a sans-serif font.
- PT Sans is used for the body text on the site. It is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery
Images used are from the site https://www.freepik.com/

### Wireframe
I have created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

Just screen shots from the onld and new version!

### Features
The website is planned as a multi-page project. These pages can be accessed via the navigation menu. There are the Home, News, Menu and Contat pages. 
In addition, a thank you page has been created for sending a message.  <span style="color:yellow"> Wurde das Gemacht??? oder anders gelöst </span>
- Feature of all pages:
    - The header with a navigation bar is positioned in the top right corner. This navigation bar can be used to navigate the page. To the left is an icon of a pair of dice, matching the boardgames theme.  <span style="color:yellow"> Burger icon??? In the mobile view? </span>

    - In addition, the footer is the same on all pages. The footer contains the address of the bar and the social media icon with links to instergram and facebook.

- Home Page <span style="color:yellow"> PRÜFEN </span>
    - Below the header is a background image with a view of the bar. On the picture you can read the words "Welcome at the BBB Boardgame Bar Bonn".
    - The first section of the page is an About that briefly explains the bar and the concept.
    - Followed by the 2nd section which draws attention to the news and invites you to follow a link there for more information.
    - The 3rd section is an explanation of how to "plan your first visit". It is a 4 steps guide. Icons have been used here to lighten up the presentation, matching the points that are explained. The menu is link to a subpage and the list of the game collection to an external page. 
    - The 4 section has information about the price in the bar. 
    - The 5 section is the opening hours of the bar
    - The 6 section is directions on how to find the bar.

- News Page
    - Below the header is a background image with a view of the bar. On the picture you can read the words "Boardgame Bar Bonn News". Below this, in the first section, is a text describing the last weekly offer with a corresponding picture. After that the previous offer can be seen in a separate section in the same scheme. The last section is the description of the latest new game on the site. Also with a detailed picture
    - Burger icon??? In the mobile view? <span style="color:yellow"> PRÜFEN </span>

- Menu Page:
    - On the Menu page, you are greeted by the Menu heading. The menu page has 2 sections. The 1st section contains all drinks. Here are 3 lists divided into hot drinks, cold drinks and alcoholic drinks. The 2nd section contains the dishes on offer. These are divided into the 4 categories Burger&Pizza, Fingerfood, Sancks and Dips
    - Burger icon??? In the mobile view? <span style="color:yellow"> PRÜFEN </span>

- Contact Page.
    - On the contact page there is a form in which you can enter your name, first name, e-mail address and telephone number. The phone number is optional. The other fields are mandatory. 
    - Below this are radio buttons where you have to select the reason for the message. There is a choice. Reservation, Question Subscribe to newsletter, Request for a callback. This allows the messages to be pre-sorted by topic. This is followed by a text input field. With a send button underneath. Burger icon??? In the mobile view? <span style="color:yellow"> PRÜFEN </span>

- Thank You Page.
    - Thank you message for the transmitter of the night. "Thank you for your message, we will reply as soon as possible"
    - Is there the <span style="color:yellow"> PRÜFEN </span>

- Future Implementations.
    - Redesign the thank you page, for a better Look to the rest of the website.
    - At first I had planned to create my own news page. Due to my own schedule for this project I have discarded this.. Only the two latest news will be listed on the homepage. The own page will be realized in the future. 
    - There should be more detailed pictures of the bar with the individual rooms in a page with the title "Our premises". These pictures will be taken by a professional photographer and were not yet available at the start of the project. There will also be a 3D tour of the bar so that customers can get a better impression before their visit. 
    - A booking system is to be added where tables and seats can be booked and reserved online. This will make the staff's work easier and offer more convenience for guests, as they will receive a direct response and will not have to wait for feedback. At the same time, a member area is created. Java script and a backend are required for this.
    - The games are recorded in a separate database and guests can search for specific categories and have new games suggested to them. The games can also be loaned out for a limited period of time so that guests can play the games at home. All games in the game library are to be presented in course presentations. In addition, the rules should be explained in a video which is linked to the database entry. These instructions will be linked to the games in the store via a QR code. The guest can therefore also scan the QR code in the store and watch the instructions and video.
    - The belly system is also to be extended to the games. These should also be able to be reserved later for an additional charge. At the same time, it will be possible to determine which games are the most popular. These games can then be played several times and a ranking of the most played games can be published on the website. 
    - If guests would like to purchase the games themselves in order to own one, an online store for board games is also planned to be linked to the website.

### Accessibility
To ensure Accessibility the following things were done:
- I used semantic HTML
- I used descriptive alt attributes for images
- I provided information for screen readers
- I used good color contrast and a tested color palette

### W3C Validator
I used thz W3C calidator to check the HTML and the CSS code on all pages of the website of the project.
CSS:
 - I had a unused calss in the css code. 
 - I had a not in use curly bracket in for the Fotter section in the css code.
 - I had twice a color rule for the same atribute in the code.
 - I had a 0 in a padding code, which was to muche there.

HTML:
    index.html
 - I had some unsed bits of Code in the index Html for classes, Which i could just delite.
 - I had had " in the i element for the dice logo.
 - I hat a error in the iframe from the "map". Width 100& was not Ok. So i look for anthoer way to add the map.
 - I had a typo. I worte th insted of td in one table elment in the mene html.
 - I hat a h3 putted in a table in the meunu html. Copy Past mistake.
 - I had twice the same id in the contact form in use.




### Solved Bugs
- The links in the main seaction change the color to black. I needed to adress the a elements. Then the color changed.

- The textfilds in the form had no padding. Thatwhy you could not read the text very well. This came up in a mentoring session. And I added a pedding to all those input filds.

- I tried to style the links and the logo in the header and to the cplor black. This was not successful with an Id. Here I had to address the a Element for the logo directly to solve the problem

- I tried to style the social links in the footer white. Initially again via an Id. in the Ul element. This was not successful either. The task could be solved via a class directly in the a Element.

- I made a mistake when linking to a feedback page that the user should see after filling out the contact form. Instead of using the method="get", I had incorrectly used post. Through research in Slack I came up with this solution.

 - Hier fehlt text <span style="color:yellow"> PRÜFEN </span> 

### Known unsolved Bugs
 - For the Galaxy Fold cell phone, the prices in the "Our playing fees" section are not perfectly in line with the descriptions of the phones included. All other screen sizes look OK. Here I have to try to find a solution later with Flexbox via align-items. But I did not succeed. Therefore, the section may have to be created again as a table.
