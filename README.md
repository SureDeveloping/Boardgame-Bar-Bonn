## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Situation
I was hired by the operator of the Boardgame Bar Bonn to create a website for their bar. The bar has a new concept that is currently unique in Bonn and is not yet known to many people. The bar has a large collection of games available for guests to borrow and play. The Boardgame Bar Bonn aims to become a permanent meeting place for all board game lovers and fans in Bonn and the surrounding area. It wants to create an incentive to try out new games and make new contacts with like-minded people.

The bar only opened 3 months ago. The website is an important means for the bar to become better known and to attract attention. It offers all the necessary information at a glance and distributes all information to both regular customers and interested parties.

Visitors to the site are board game enthusiasts aged between 10 and 70. There are also games for younger people in the bar. It is assumed that they will visit the bar accompanied by an adult and will therefore not inform themselves.

The website should provide guests with all the important information about the bar so that they can plan their visit. It makes work easier for operators and staff because the same questions that keep coming up are no longer necessary. At the same time, the website increases awareness of the bar and contributes to customer loyalty by providing up-to-date information.

The most important information is therefore the concept of the bar, opening hours, address, contact details, news and the menus.

### User Story

## Designnce
### Color Scheme
In consultation with the customer, the colors were based on the colors of the locale. Bright, friendly shades were chosen there. I used the website https://mycolor.space/ to find other matching colors for the base color.
